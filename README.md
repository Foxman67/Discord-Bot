# Discord-Bot
simple project bot made to learn python

meant to just take in trainer id's from users and store them attached to there userID
then proceeds to check if an added ID already exists and informs the user
should be able to do several game types from the series

while i never finished the full scope of this project, it would be usable in repurposing for other bot uses since it can connect to discord and communicate
